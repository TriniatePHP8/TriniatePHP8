- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TriniatePHP8

- This is a special account created by @HotPizzaYT for the sole purpose of getting Triniate to work on PHP 8, because in its current state, it does not work.
- Efforts made may be merged into a new branch of Triniate, and this account will redirect to the original Triniate project.
<!---
TriniatePHP8/TriniatePHP8 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
